# Ip2tools

`Ip2tools` is a Python script that allows you to fetch the geolocation of a website's IP address by using its URL. The tool retrieves the IP address, its corresponding geolocation (latitude and longitude), and generates a Google Maps link to view the location.

## Features

- **URL Validation**: Validates whether the provided URL is properly formatted.
- **IP Address Resolution**: Resolves the domain of the URL to get the corresponding IP address.
- **Geolocation Lookup**: Uses the IPinfo API to fetch the latitude and longitude of the resolved IP address.
- **Google Maps Link**: Generates a Google Maps link for easy viewing of the IP's location on the map.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays a loading bar while fetching geolocation information.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `pyfiglet`, `tqdm`, `python-dotenv`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ip2tools.git
cd ip2tools
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies:**
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the IPinfo API.
- `pyfiglet`: For ASCII art banner rendering.
- `tqdm`: For creating a progress bar.
- `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables securely.

3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script and add your IPinfo API key. If you don't have an API key, you can get it from [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/signup).

Example `.env` file:

```
IPINFO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python script.py
```

2. Enter a valid URL when prompted (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).

3. The script will:
   - Validate the URL.
   - Retrieve the IP address associated with the URL.
   - Fetch the geolocation data for the IP.
   - Show the latitude and longitude of the IP and display a Google Maps link for the location.

Example:

```
Enter a URL: https://www.example.com
IP: 93.184.216.34
Latitude: 37.751
Longitude: -97.822
Google Maps Link: https://www.google.com/maps?q=37.751,-97.822
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid URL Error**: If the URL is not valid, ensure that the format follows the correct pattern (`http://example.com` or `https://example.com`).
- **API Key Missing**: Ensure the `.env` file is in the same directory as the script and contains the correct API key.
- **Geolocation Not Available**: Not all IP addresses have geolocation data available. In such cases, the script will notify you of the issue.
